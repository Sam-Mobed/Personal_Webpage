# Personal_Webpage
This first project is dedicated to making my own personal webpage. The page will contain information about my background, my coding journey, personal projects, classes that I am taking, and so on. I will put into practice what I have learned up until now in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The site will look very bare at first, but I will add functionnalities and style it as time goes on. 

There are no specific guidelines on how to use the page; simply proceed as you would with any normal webpage. 

The gitignore file was made thanks to gitignore.io (hosted by Toptal). Nothing special about the file itself, the format is made specfically for files to be ignored on MacOS and VisualStudioCode.  

Since this repo was made only for the development of my personal site, adding a license to it is unnecessary. Note that I am the only contributor, and no one else can push changes to the repo (it would defeat the purpose of the project).
